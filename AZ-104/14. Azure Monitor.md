# Metrics
- Metrics are quantitative measurements that show snapshots of application or resource performance
- Metrics are typically numeric values that you can measure over time
- They provide an understanding of various aspects of an application or resource, such as resource utilization, response times, error rates, and throughput
	- CPU usage, Memory usage, Network Latency, and Transaction Rates are types of metrics
- A list of resource-specific metrics is **automatically available** for each resource type in your Azure subscription
- **Azure Monitor** can collect several types of metrics, such as:
	- **Azure platform metrics**: It starts collecting metrics data from Azure resources as soon as they're added to a subscription
	- **Custom Metrics**: Azure monitor can also collect metrics from other sources, including applications and agents running on VMs. Those custom metrics can be send to Azure Monitor via **Azure Monitor Agent**, other agents and extensions, or directly to Azure Monitor REST API
	- **Prometheus Metrics**: It collects metrics from AKS or other Kubernetes Cluster
- Metrics are well-suited for real-time monitoring
- You can use metrics to trigger alerts when defined thresholds are reached
# Logs
- Logs are textual records of events, actions, and messages that occur in a resource or application
- It can include the following type of data:
	- **Text**: Human-readable text entries that provide context, details, and descriptions of events
	- **Unstructured Data**: Log entries in various formats that don't fit neatly into predefined numerical values
	- **Contextual Information**: Insights into the context surrounding an event, which is invaluable for root cause analysis
- Logs can capture information about errors, warnings, user actions, and application state changes
- They can provide detailed narratives of events in a given context. This make them crucial for troubleshooting, debugging, and understanding event sequences that lead to issues
- Azure Monitor Logs is a feature of Azure Monitor that lets you **store, manage, and analyze log and performance** data from monitored resources
- To collect and analyze all your data, set up a common workspace called **Log Analytics Workspace**
	- Resources can be configured to send their data to that workspace
# Insights
- Some Azure resource providers have created visualizations that provide a customized monitoring experience and required minimal configuration
- Azure Monitor includes **many types of Insights**
## Application Insights
- It provides **application performance monitoring (APM)**
	- You can proactively monitor to see how well an application is performing, and reactively review application execution data to find the cause of an incident
- Along with metrics and telemetry, you can use app insights to **collect and store** trace logging data
	- For that you just need to configure the destination of the logs
- **Distributed Tracing** which is known as distributed component correlation
	- Allows searching for and visualizing the end-to-end flow of a specific execution or transaction
- **Live Metrics**: Observe activity from your deployed application in real time with no effect on the host environment
- **Availability Monitoring**: Known as synthetic transaction monitoring, probes the **external endpoints** of your application to test overall availability and responsiveness over time
- **Smart Detection**: Detects failures and anomalies automatically through proactive telemetry analysis
- **Application Map**: A high-level, top-down view of your application architecture with at-a-glance visual references to component health and responsiveness
## Container Insights
- Gives you performance visibility into containerized workloads deployed to AKS or Azure Container Instances
- It collects container logs and metrics from **controllers, nodes, and containers**
## VM Insights
- Monitors and analyzes Azure Windows and Linux VMs, **including VMs hosted on-premises** or **in other cloud**
- Identifies processes, application dependencies, and interconnect dependencies on external processes
## Network Insights
- Visual representation of health and metrics for all deployed network resources through topologies
- It grants access to network monitoring capabilities
# Workbooks
- Flexible canvas for analyzing data and creating rich visual reports in the Azure Portal
- Query data from multiple sources and combine and correlate data from multiple data sets in one visualization
# Dashboards
- Combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal
# Power BI
- Business Analytics service that provides interactive visualizations across various data sources
- You can configure Power BI to **automatically import log data** from Azure Monitor
# Actions
- An effective monitoring solution **proactively responds** to critical events without the need for an individual or team to notice the issue
## Artificial Intelligence of IT Operations (AIOps)
- AIOps describes the use of AI and Machine Learning techniques to enhance and automate aspects of IT operations and infrastructure management
- Azure Monitor has features that use machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate data-driven tasks: predict capacity usage, identify performance issues, and detect anomalies
## Azure Monitor Alerts
- Notify you of critical conditions and can take corrective action
- It can be based on **metric or log data**
- Alert rules provide **near-real time alerts**
- Alert rules use **action groups**, which can take actions such as sending email or SMS notifications
- Action groups can send notifications using webhooks to trigger external processes or to integrate with IT service management tool
## Autoscale
- Dynamically adjust the number of resources running to handle the load on your applications
- You can create rules that use Azure Monitor metrics to determine when to automatically add or remove resources
