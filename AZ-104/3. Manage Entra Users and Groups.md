- Azure AD is the identity and access management solution for Azure Cloud
- Inside of Entra ID tenant (or Azure AD tenant), we have **identity objects** like users
- We can have several types of users: from Administrators to Developers
- All users should have a configured set of privileges to work on Azure, based on their roles
- There are three most-regular types of members on an Entra ID tenant: **Administrators; Members; Guests**

# Users
##  User Types
- **Internal Member**;
- **Internal Guest**: have an account in your tenant, but have guest-level privileges
- **External Member**: these users authenticate using an external account, but have member access to your tenant (common on multitenant organizations)
- **External Guest**: these users are true guests of your tenant who authenticate using an external method and who have guest-level privileges
- The authentication differ based on the type of user you create
	- **Internal** guests and members have their credentials in your tenant that can be managed by you or by the administrators; they can also **reset their own password**
	- **External** guests and members authenticate to their home tenant and your tenant authenticates the user through a federated sign-in with the external member's tenant; if the external members forget their password, **the administrator in their tenant can reset their password**
## Create User
### Basic
- Mail nickname; Display Name; and Password are required fields while the user principal name is not
### Properties
- There are six categories of user properties. These properties can be **added or updated after the user is created**
- Identity
### Assignments
- You can assign the user to an **administrative unit, group, or Microsoft Entra role** when the account is created
- You can assign the user to up 20 groups or roles
- The user can be assigned to only one administrative unit
- Assignments **can be added after the user creation**
## Create External User
### Basic
- The basic section is similar to the previous one but with those variations:
	- Instead of user principal name and mail nickname, specify the user's email for sign-in;
	- You can add multiple emails to the user
### Properties
- User type doesn't affect external users
- Authorization info field is unavailable for external users
- Job information, the employee and manager-related information is unavailable for external users
### Assignments
- Add administrative unit and add role options are unavailable for external users
## Invite External User
### Basic
- In this section you're inviting the guest to your tenant using **their email address**
- To create a guest user with a domain account, use the create new user process but change the user type to guest
- The email is required;
- Display Name and Invitation Message are optional
### Guest User Invitation
- When you invite an external user, you can check the invitation status from the user's details
	- Locate B2B collaboration tile

## Users in Bulk
- Entra ID supports bulk user **create** and **delete** operations and supports downloading lists of users
- You must sign in at least as User Administrator
- To do that, you must fill out comma-separated values (CSV) template
- The bulk operation can be performed on Microsoft Entra admin center on All Users > Users > Bulk create
![[Pasted image 20250414211943.png]]
- To delete with a bulk operation is the same: you must download the CSV file, fill it out, and upload it back to Azure

## Manage Settings for All Users
- It's possible to set permissions and default permissions to all users from the **Microsoft Entra admin center**
- You must log in there as a **Global Administrator**
![[Pasted image 20250414211158.png]]
- Things like allow users to register their own applications; prevent non-admins from creating their own tenants; Allow users to create security groups; Guest user access restrictions; and more.
### Bulk Operations
- Microsoft Entra admin center allows editing certain user attributes in bulk
- You can select up to 60 users at a time and update their attributes at once
# Groups
- Entra groups let you grant access and permissions to a group of users instead of to each individual user
## Group Types
- **Security Groups**
	- Used to manage access to shared resources; members of a security group can include users, devices, service principals
	- Groups can be members of other groups, known as nested groups
	- Users and service principals can be the owner of a security group
- **Microsoft 365 Groups**
	- Members of a M365 group can only include users
	- Users and service principals can be the owner of a M365 group
	- People outside of the organization can be the owner of the group
## Membership Types
- **Assigned Groups**
	- Lets you add specific users as members of a group and have unique permissions
	- That works as casual manual inclusion (my note)
- **Dynamic Membership Group for Users**
	- Use rules to automatically add and remove users as members
	- If a member's attributes change, the system looks at your rules for dynamic membership groups
	- If a user attribute meets the rule requirement, the user is added, if no longer meets the rule requirement, it is removed
- **Dynamic Membership Group for Devices**
	- The same as for users
## Assignment Types
- **Direct Assignment**
	- The resource owner directly assigns the user to the resource
- **Group Assignment**
	- The resource owner assigns a group to the resource; that automatically grants permission to that resource to all group members
	- Both the group owner and the resource owner manage group membership, letting either owner add or remove members from the group
- **Rule-based Assignment**
	- The resource owner uses a rule to define which users are assigned to a specific resource
	- The rule is based on attributes that are assigned to individual users
	- The resource owner manages the rule, determining which attributes and values are required to allow access the resource
## Create Group
- Enter the Group Type: security or M365
- Enter the Group Name
- Select the membership type: Assigned; Dynamic Users; Dynamic Devices
- Owners and Members can be added later on
- **Entra roles can be assigned to the group** is an option available for P1 or P2 licenses;
	- It enables to add Microsoft Entra ID Roles to the group
	- You must have at least the Privileged Role Administrator
	- This option automatically selects Assigned as the Membership type
## Edit Group
- You can edit a group's name, description, or membership type
- Needs Groups Administrator or User Administrator for that
## Add a Group to Another Group
- For the **Security Type**, you can add an existing group to another group
- Depending on the membership type of the group, you can add another group as a member of your group
