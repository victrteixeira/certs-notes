# Overview
- Azure App Gateway is an Azure service that process traffic to web apps that are hosted on a pool of web servers
- HTTP traffic;
- Inspect of traffic using web application firewall (WAF)
- The **pool** of web servers can be Azure VMs, Azure VMSS, Azure App Service, or even on-premise servers
- App Gateway uses round-robin process to load balance requests to the servers in the back-end pool
	- Session stickiness can ensure that the same client receive from the same server though
- **Features**
	- Support for HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, and WebSocket protocols
	- WAF
	- End-to-end encryption
	- Autoscaling to dynamically adjust capacity as your web traffic load change
	- Connection draining allowing graceful removal of back-end pool members during planned service updates
# General Configurations
## Front-end IP address
- Client requests are received through a front-end IP address
- App Gateway **can have** a **public IP address**, a **private IP address**, or **both**
	- They can't have more than one public or private IP address
## Listeners
- App Gateway uses one or more listeners to receive incoming requests
- A listener **accepts traffic on a specific combination of** **protocol, port, host, and IP address**
- Each listener routes traffic to a back-end pool of servers following **routing rules**
## Routing Rules
- It binds a listener to the back-end pools
- The rule specify how to interprete the hostname and path in the URL of a request and direct the request to the appropriate back-end pool
## Load Balancing
- It load balances the requests using round-robin mechanism
- Works at OSI Layer 7: it load balances requests based on the routing parameters (host names and paths) 
## WAF
- Optional component that handles incoming requests before they reach a listener
- It checks each request for many common threats based on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
- SQL-Injection; Cross-Site Scripting; Command Injection; HTTP Request Smuggling; HTTP Response Splitting; Remote File Inclusion; Bots; Crawlers, and Scanners; HTTP Protocol Violations and Anomalies
## Routing
- **Path-based**: self-explanatory. It routes based on the path.
- **Multiple-site routing**: It routes based on the host name, making possible to have more than one site route in the same App Gateway ![[Pasted image 20250218092226.png|300]]
- **Redirection**: Redirect the request to another site, or from HTTP to HTTPS
- **Rewrite HTTP headers**: Allows the client or the server to pass parameter information with the request or the response
- **Custom Error Pages**
## AutoScaling
- It supports autoscaling, and can **scale up** or **scale down** based on changing traffic load patterns.
- Autoscaling also removes the requirement to choose a deployment size or instance count during provisioning
