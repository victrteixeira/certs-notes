# Region
- **Each** Storage Account region will have **its own prices**
	- Korea can be cheaper than South America for exemple
- Microsoft Azure has over 60 regions, but not all of them are available to us
- It's common sense that the region for the storage account should be **closer to the consumer** of the data
## Redundancy
- The **redundancy setting** for a storage account **is shared for all storage services** exposed by that account
- All storage resources **deployed in the same storage account** have the **same redundancy setting**
### Primary Region Redundancy
- **LRS - Locally Redundant Storage**: copies your data *synchronously* three times within a **single physical location** in the primary region
	- Least expensive solution; not recommended for applications requiring high availability or durability
- **ZRS - Zone Redundant Storage**: copies your data *synchronously* across three **Azure Availability Zones** in the primary region
	- For applications that require high availability.
### Secondary Region Redundancy
- **GRS - Geo-Redundant Storage**: copies your data *synchronously* three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data *asynchronously* to a single physical location in the secondary region.
	- Within the secondary region, the data is copied *synchronously* three times using LRS
- **GZRS - Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage**: copies your data *synchronously* across three **Azure Availability Zones** in the primary region using ZRS. It then copies your data *asynchronously* to a single physical location in the secondary region.
	- Within the secondary region, your data is copied *synchronously* three times using LRS.
- Data in the secondary region **isn't available for read or write access** unless there's a failover to the primary region
- To enable read access, you must configure it on your storage account:
	- Read Access: **RA-GRS or RA-GZRS**
# Networking
## Network Access
- **Enable Public Access from all networks**
	- It does not mean the storage account is open, but it tells you can access the storage account from an endpoint
		- If you have the Storage Account Keys you can access that endpoint
- **Enable Public Access from Selected Virtual Networks and IP Addresses**
	- You can select the virtual networks that you created across your Azure Subscriptions and the subnets, if you need more granular control over how can access the data.
- **Disable Public Access and Use Private Access**
	- You disable public access and start working with Private Links (Private Endpoints)
# Encryption
- **MMK - Microsoft-managed Keys**: You use microsoft encryption to the hard disks that store your data
- **CMK - Customer-managed Keys**: You use your own set of keys to encrypt the disks that store your data on Azure
	- For that, you'll need to specify the keys.
- **Infrastructure Encryption**
	- That's a way to doubly encrypt your data. It protects against a scenario where one of the encryption algorithms or keys might be compromised
	- It can enabled for the entire storage account or an encryption scope within an account.
## Blob Storage
- The difference between online and offline tiers is that within online tiers, your data can be accessed immediately, unlike the archive tier which is an offline tier. It has higher data retrieval costs, and can take some time to be accessible, on the order of hours
- A storage account can go up to **5 Petabytes of data**
## Access Tiers
- **Hot Tier**
	- An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified **frequently**.
	- It has the highest **storage** costs, but the lowest **access** costs.
- **Cool Tier**
	- An online tier optimized for storing data that is **infrequently** accessed or modified
	- Data in cool tier should be **stored for a minimum of 30 days**
	- The cool tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the hot tier
- **Cold Tier**
	- An online tier optimized for storing data that is **rarely** accessed or modified, but still **requires fast retrieval**
	- Data in the cold tier should be **stored for a minimum of 90 days**
	- The cold tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier
- **Archive Tier**
	- An offline tier optimized for storing data that is **rarely** accessed, and that has **flexible latency requirements**
	- Data in the archive tier should be **stored for a minimum of 180 days**
# Data Protection and Tracking
- Storage Account allows you to enable **Soft Delete**
	- It means you can set a specific amount of time (7 days, 30 days) before a data is indeed deleted
	- Soft Delete **marks** a data to be deleted, but before the set period of time, it does not deletes it
- **Versioning** is a way of track changes to your data.
	- If a data has versioning enabled, it can result in an increased cost to your Storage Account
	- Versioning is basically accumulating data. It is recommended to set a lifecycle policy: from "x" versions, you can start the delete the previous one; or maintain only 5 versions of the same data
- **Change Feed** enables you to be notified when a data changes
- **Immutability** is the idea of when you write a piece of data is written, it can't be deleted
	- Storage Accounts enable you to set a **time-based retention policy** that will apply to all blob versions protected by immutability
# Data Storage
- Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's **object** storage solution for the cloud
- Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of **unstructured data**
## Containers
- A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system
- A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs
## Azure Files
- Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments
- Azure Files can be **mounted** concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments
- Accessible via **SMB protocol**, **NFS protocol**, and Azure Files REST API
## Queues
- A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components
- Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages
- A queue message can be up to **64 KB in size**
- A queue may contain millions of messages, up to the **total capacity limit of a storage account**
- It can accessed anywhere in the world via HTTP/HTTPS authenticated calls
## Tables
- A **NoSQL store** for schemaless storage of structured data
- Azure Table storage is a service that stores **non-relational structured data** in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store
# Access Control
## Access Keys
- When an storage account is created, Azure generates two 512-bit storage account access keys
- These keys ban be used to authorize access to data in your storage account via **Shared Key authorization**, or via **SAS Tokens** that are **signed** with the shared key
## Shared Access Keys (SAS)
- A SAS provides secure delegated access to resources in your storage account
- With a SAS, you have granular control over how a client can access your data
### Types
- **User Delegation SAS**
	- A user delegation SAS is secured with Microsoft Entra credentials and also by the permissions specified for the SAS
	- It **applies to blob storage only**
- **Service SAS**
	- A service SAS is secured with the storage account key
	- A service SAS delegates access to a resource in **only one of the Azure storage services**: Blob storage, Queue storage, Table storage, or Azure Files
- **Account SAS**
	- An account SAS is secured with the storage account key
	- An account SAS delegates to resources in **one or more of the storage services**
	- All of the operations available via a service or user delegation SAS are also available via an account SAS
- ==EXAM TIP==: An SAS can not be revoked after created until it expires, however it can be done invalid by rotating the Access Key used to sign the SAS token
## Stored Access Policies
- Provides an additional level of control over service-level over SASs on the server side
- Serves to group SAS and to provide additional restrictions for signatures that are bound by the policy
- You can use a Stored Access Policy to **revoke a signature** after it has been issued
## Entra ID Access Control for Storage
- Azure Storage supports using Entra ID to authorize requests to blob data
- With Entra ID, you can use **Azure Role-Based Access Control** to grant permissions to a **security principal**, which may be a user, group or application service principal
# Managing Data
## AzCopy
- AzCopy is a command-line utility that you can use to copy blobs or files to or from a storage account
- It can be used to copy data **to, from, or between** Azure Storage Accounts
## Storage Browser
- Storage Browser is a Storage Account manager, available on the portal or through the app.
- It allows you to upload, download, and manage Azure Storage Blobs, files, queues, and tables using the UI
## Object Replication
- It copies **asynchronously - without SLA on how long it takes to replicate -** from the source container to the destination container
	- ==Example==: a photo *.png* stored in *importantContainer* will be replicated asynchronously to the *backupContainer*
# Azure File Share
- It's Microsoft's easy-to-use cloud **file system**
- You can **mount** SMB Azure File Shares in Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems
- There are two tiers: **Standard (HDD)** and **Premium (SSD)**. Standard tier has redundancy types of LRS, ZRS, GRS, and GZRS, and **Premium tier has redundancy types of LRS and ZRS only**
## Azure File Sync
- It enables you to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files
- Azure File Sync additionally has the ability to transform Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share
- **Sync Groups**
	- Sync Group is the object that defines the sync relationship between a **cloud endpoint**, or Azure File Share, and a **server endpoint**
	- Endpoints within a sync group are kept **in sync** with each other
- **Cloud Tiering**
	- With it enabled, your most frequently accessed files are cached on your local server and your least frequently accessed files are tiered to the cloud
	- You can control how much local disk space is used for caching
# Storage Kind
- There are two kind but four types of storage account: **Standard and Premium**; Standard General-Purpose v2, Premium Block Blobs, Premium File Shares, and Premium Page Blobs
## Standard
- It utilizes HDDs and offer lower performance. It is suitable for general-purpose storage needs with moderate performance requirements
- It is more cost-effective, as it offers a lower performance. It's ideal for large volumes of data where the performance is not critical
- Available for all Storage Account services: Blobs, File Shares, Queues and Tables
## Premium
- It uses SSDs and offer high performance with significantly higher IOPS. Suitable for performance critical applications such as I/O-intensive applications like databases
- It is more expensive for its performance benefits
- Not available for all storage account services: Block Blobs, File Shares and Page Blobs
