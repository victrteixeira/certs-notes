- It is an Azure service that provides cost effective, secure, and zero-infrastructure backup solutions for **ALL** Azure-managed **data assets**.

| **Zero-infrastructure<br>backup solution** | Unlike conventional backup solutions, no backup server or infrastructure is needed. Similarly, no backup storage needs to be deployed, because Azure Backup automatically manages and scales it. | Zero-infrastructure solution eliminates capital expenses and reduces operational expenses. It increases ease of use by automating storage management.                                                                                    |
| **At-scale management**                    | Natively manage your entire backup estate from a central console called Backup Center. Use APIs, PowerShell, and Azure CLI to automate Backup policy and security configurations.                | Backup center simplifies data protection management at-scale by enabling you to discover, govern, monitor, operate, and optimize backup management from one unified console, which helps you to drive operational efficiency with Azure. |
| **Security**                               | Azure Backup provides built-in security to your backup environment, both when your data is in transit and at rest by using capabilities encryption, private endpoints, alerts, and so on.        | Your backups are automatically secured against ransomware, malicious admins, and accidental deletions.                                                                                                                                   |
# RPO and RTO
- **Recovery Time Objective** is more related to time, as the name suggest: how long your company can sustain and outage before unacceptable consequences
	- If an application goes down and the server can sustain a maximum of four hours of downtime, then the RTO is four hours
- **Recovery Point Objective** says about the maximum of **data loss**, measured in time
- **Examples**:
	- If the **RPO** of a company is one hour, the database perform backups each hour to achieve this RPO, that way you won't lose more than one hour of data
	- However, when the **RTO** is set to three hours, if a failure occurs, you aim to restore access to the database within three hours to minimize the impact on operations
# Backup Functionality
- **Workload Integration Tier - Backup Extension**: Integration with the actual workload, such as Azure virtual machines or Azure Blobs
- **Data Plane - Access Tiers**: There are three access tiers where backups could be stored
	- Snapshot tier
	- Standard tier
	- Archive tier
- **Data Plane - Availability and Security**: The backup data is replicated across zones or regions, based on the redundancy the user specifies
- **Management Plane - Vaults and Center**: The vault provides an interface for the user to interact with the backup service
## On-Premise Backups
- For on-premises **Windows machines**, it's possible to back up directly to Azure using the **MARS (Microsoft Azure Recovery Services) agent**
- You also can back up these Windows machines to a backup server, such as a DPM (System Center Data Protection Manager) or MABS (Microsoft Azure Backup Server)
## Azure Backups
- For Azure VMs, you can back them up directly
- Azure installs a **backup extension** to the Azure VM agent that's running on the VM that allows back up the entire VM
	- If you only want to back up the files and folders on the VM, you can do so by running the **MARS agent**
- Azure stores backed-up data in vaults: **Recovery Services vaults** and **Backup vaults**
- A vault is an online-storage entity in Azure that's used to hold data such as backup copies, recovery points, and backup policies
## Backup Types
- Azure Backup supports **full backups** and **incremental backups**
- The initial backup is a full backup and the next ones will be incremental backups
	- By incremental it means it will back up only the blocks changed since the last backup
- Azure Backup also supports **SQL Server backup types**
	- **Full**;
	- **Differential**: like incremental backups, it only backs up what have changed
	- **Multiple backups per day**: minimum RPO of 4 hours and maximum of 24 hours
	- **Selective disk backup**: Select a subset of **data disks** attached to your VM and back them up
	- **Transaction log**: A log backup enables point-in-time restoration up to a specific second
## Workload Integration Layer
- A backup extension is installed on the source VM or a worker VM
- At the time of the backup, it generates the backup which could be
	- **Storage**: Snapshots when using an Azure VM or Azure Files
	- **Stream Backup**: For databases like SQL or HANA (High-Performance Analytic Appliance) running in VMs
- The data is transferred in the **data plane**
## Data Plane - Access Tiers
- **Snapshot Tier**: the snapshot is taken and stored along with the disk. 
	- This is faster then restoring from a vault, because it eliminates the wait time for snapshots to be copied from the vault before triggering the restore operation
	- The snapshots are retained in the **customer's subscription** in a specific resource group
- **Vault-standard Tier**: backup data for all workloads supported by **Azure Backup** is stored in vaults, which hold backup storage, an autoscaling set of storage accounts managed by Azure Backup
	- That's an online tier that allows isolated copy of backup data in a **Microsoft-managed tenant**. Workloads where snapshot tier is supported, there's a copy of the backup data in both the snapshot tier and the vault-standard tier
- **Archive Tier**: Long-Term Retention (LTR) backup data is supported by Azure Backup in the archive tier
- All tiers offer **different** RTO and are priced differently.
## Data Plane - Availability and Security
- Backup Data is replicated across zones or regions
- LRS; ZRS; or GRS
- Data is kept **safe by encrypting** it and implementing Azure RBAC
- You're enable to choose who perform backup and restore operations on your backup data
- Azure Backup also provides protection against malicious deletion of your backup by using **soft-delete operations**
	- Deleted backup is stored for 14 days, **free of charge**
- Azure Backup provides **data lifecycle-management** scenario to comply with retention policies
## Backup Consistency Levels
- Depending on how the snapshot is taken and what it includes, you can achieve different levels of consistency on your backups
### Application Consistent
- The snapshot captures the VM as a whole
- It uses VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) to capture the content of the machine memory and any pending I/O operations
- For Linux Machines, you need to write **custom pre or post scripts per app** to capture the application state
- You can get complete consistency for the VM and all running applications
### File System Consistent
- If VSS fails on Windows, or the pre and post scripts fail on linux, Azure Backup still creates a file-system consistent snapshot
- During a recovery, no corruption occurs within the machine
	- Installed applications need to do their own cleanup during startup to become consistent
### Crash Consistent
- This level of consistency occurs if the VM is shut down at the time of the backup
- No I/O operations or memory contents are captured during this type of backup
- It does not guarantee data consistency for the OS or app
## Good to Know
- Azure Backup **does not support** cross-region backup for most workloads
- Azure Backup **does support** cross-region restore **in a paired secondary region**
- Azure Backup is able to back up entire Windows and Linux VMs using **backup extensions**
	- If you only want to back up certain files, folders, and system state, you can use the MARS agent
- If the main concern is to only back up the SQL Server **data**, it offers a **stream-based, specialized solution** to back up SQL Servers running in Azure VMs
- It's possible to implement **access-control mechanisms** for the backups
- RBAC boundaries are available to restrict access to backups only to authorized Backup Admins
## Restore Types
- Azure Backup provides many ways to restore a VM
- You can either instantly restore from the snapshot tier or from the vault tier
- It's possible to recover **individual files** from a recovery point by mounting the snapshot on the target machine using iSCSI initiator in the machine
- Azure Backup supports the backup and restore of machines encrypted through **Disk Encryption**
	- It works with Azure Key Vault to manage the relevant secrets that are associated with the encrypted disk
	- File-level or folder-level restore **are not supported** with encrypted VMs
	- The **Replace Existing option is not available** for encrypted VMs
### Restore Options List
- Create a New VM
- Restore Disk
- Replace Existing
- Cross Region (secondary paired region)
- Cross Subscription
- Cross Zonal
- Selective Disk Backup
