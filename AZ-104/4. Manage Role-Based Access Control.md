# RBAC Overview
- RBAC is a **security feature** in Azure that allows you to grant specific permissions to users, groups, or applications **based on their roles** in your organization
- RBAC grants very **granular control** over permissions.
## Potential Drawbacks of Permission Management
- Principle of Least Privilege: a person might have a policy permission attached that grants too much power;
- Some users don't have permissions to things they need when they need them;
- More effort (cost) to maintain: you've needed to update the user permission every time, and remove it when it's not necessary anymore;
- Slows down everyone - lower productivity;
- Higher chance of a malicious user gaining access to the system;
### RBAC Solution
- You define a handful of "roles" across the organization;
- Creating a role, you're basically **defining a job** that someone can potentially need to do;
- Define who needs read only access, who needs to be a contributor, who needs to have ownership access to various resources;
- Roles are **abstractions** that can be assigned to individuals
	- Examples: Developer; Development Manager; IT Operations; Report Reader; Global Administrator
- A person can have more than one role without any kind of conflict
- With RBAC solution - or role solution - you manage permissions at the **role level**, not at the user level;
## Benefits of RBAC
- A level of abstraction that simplifies management;
- Simpler management means fewer errors;
- You just need to confirm users are in the right role;
- All users are treated "the same" for the role, nobody has secret extra permissions;
- Easier for new users added to the system to be assigned the correct permissions;
