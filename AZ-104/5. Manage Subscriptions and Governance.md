# Basic Concepts of Accounts & Subscriptions
- Account
- Tenant
- Subscription
- Resource Group
## Account / User
- A person or a program
- **Person** - i.e. Joe Smith - joe@example.com
	- User name, password,multi-factor authentication
- **App** - Managed Identity
	- Represents a program or service
- The basis for authentication
- 
## Tenant
- A representation of an organization
- Usually represented by a **public domain name**
	- example.com
- Will be assigned a domain if not specified
	- example.onmicrosoft.com
- A dedicated instance of **Azure Active Directory**
- Every **Azure Account** is part of at least one tenant
- **More than one account can be the owner in a tenant**
## Subscription
- An agreement with Microsoft to use Azure services, and how you're going to pay for that
- All Azure resource usage gets billed to the payment method of the subscription
	- Free Subscriptions
	- Pay as you go
	- Enterprise Agreements
- **Not every tenant needs to have a subscription**
- **Tenants can have more than one subscription**
## Resource and Resource Group
### Resources
- An entity managed by Azure
	- *Expected*: Virtual Machine, Web App, Storage Account
	- *Unexpected*: Public IP address, Network Interface Card, Network Security Group
- **Accounts can be given read, update, owner rights to resources**
### Resource Groups
- A way of organizing resources in a subscription
- A folder structure
- All resources must belong to only one resource group
- Resource groups can be deleted (which deletes the resources inside)
- A way to separating out projects, keeping unrelated things separate
### Resource Locks
- Lock an Azure subscription, resource group, or resource to protect them from accidental user deletions or modifications.
- **The lock overrides any user permissions**
	- *CanNotDelete*: means authorized users can read and modify a resource, but they can't delete it
	- *ReadOnly*: means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update it.
		- Applying this lock is similar to **restricting all authorized users** to the permissions that the **Reader** role provides
## Policy
- Policy allows you to set rules that specify what is and isn't allowed within your Azure environment
- Helps to enforce organization standards and to assess compliance at-scale
- It's possible to **extend** your policy-based governance across different cloud providers and even to your local datacenters with Azure Arc
## Tags
- Tags are metadata elements that you apply to your Azure resources
- They are key-value pairs that help you identify resources based on settings that are relevant to your organization
