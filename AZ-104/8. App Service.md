# Plan
- An application runs in an Azure App Service **plan**.
- The plan defines a set of compute resources for a web application to run
- One or more applications can be configured to run on the **same computing resources** (or in the same App Service Plan)
- When you create an App Service plan in a region, a set of compute resources is created for the plan in the specified region. Any applications that you place into the plan **run on the compute resources defined by the plan**
- Each App Service plan defines three settings:
	- **Region**
	- **Number of VM instances**: The number of virtual machines instances to allocate for the plan
	- **Size of VM instances**: The size of the virtual machine instances in the plan, including Small, Medium, or Large
	- You can continue to add new applications to an existing plan as long as the plan has enough resources to handle the increasing load
## Scaling Plan
- The Service plan is the scale unit of App Service applications
- Depending on the pricing tier for your Azure App Service plan, your applications **run and scale in a different manner**
- **Free or Shared Tier**
	- Applications run by receiving CPU minutes on a shared virtual machine instance
	- Applications **can't scale out**
- **Basic, Standard, Premium, or Isolated Tier**
	- Applications run on **all virtual machines instances** configured in the App Service plan
	- Multiple applications in the same plan share the same virtual machine instances
	- Multiple deployment slots for an application run on the same virtual machine instances
	- Diagnostic logs, perform backups, WebJobs, these tasks use CPU cycles and memory on the same virtual machine instances
- **Overloading an App Service plan can potentially cause downtime for new and existing applications**
## Pricing Plan
- There are **six categories** of pricing tiers for an Azure Service plan
- **Free; Shared; Basic; Standard; Premium; Isolated**
- Basic tier does not support Auto Scale
- Standard tier is up to 5 deployment slots and 10 max instances
## Scaling and Right Sizing
- There are two methods for scaling an Azure App Service plan and applications: **scale up and scale out**
- It's possible to scale manually or automatically, which is referred as **autoscale**
- **Scale Up** is the process of going from a down tier to an upper tier such as from Basic to Standard
	- It increases the amount of CPU, memory and disk space.
	- Gives you extra features like dedicated virtual machines, custom domains and certificates, staging slots, autoscaling and more
	- You can scale up by changing the pricing tier of the Azure App Service plan where your application is placed
- **Scale Out** is the process when you increases the number of virtual machine instances that run your application
	- You can scale out to as many as 30 instances, depending on your App Service plan pricing tier
	- Isolated tier can scale out to as many as 100 instances
### Auto Scale
- To use autoscale, you specify the **minimum, and maximum number of instances** to run by using a **set of rules and conditions**
- When your application runs under autoscale conditions, the number of virtual machines instances are automatically adjusted based on your rules
- The autoscale engine uses notification settings
	- Autoscale can notify one or more email addresses or make calls to one or more webhooks
# Service
- Every App Service runs under a Service Plan
- The name of your app must be unique. The name identifies and locates your app in Azure
- It publishes your app as code or as a Docker container
- It always have a runtime stack. It should be same software stack your app runs, including the language and SDK versions
	- For Linux apps and custom container apps, you can set an optional start-up command or file
## CI and Deployment
- The Azure portal provides out-of-the-box continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository on your development machine
- App Service auto-synchronizes your code and any future changes to the code into your web app
- With Azure DevOps, you can also define your own build and release process
	- Compile your source code, run tests, and build an deploy the release into your web app **every time you commit the code**
## Deployment Slots
- They are **live apps** that have their own hostnames
- They're available in the **Standard, Premium and Isolated App Service pricing tiers**
- Each tier offer different numbers of deployment slots
- App content and configuration elements can be **swapped** between two deployment slots, including the production slot
- ![[Pasted image 20241117130747.png]]
- **Auto Swap** streamlines Azure DevOps scenarios where your want to deploy your app continuously with zero cold starts and zero downtime for app customers
	- **It's currently supported for Web Apps on Linux**
## Security
- Azure App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support
- It's possible to sign in users and access data by writing minimal or no code in your web app, API, and mobile backend, and also your Azure Function apps
- Authentication and authorization security module in Azure App Service runs in the same environment as your application code, **yet separately**
- The security module is configured by using **app settings**
## Custom Domain Names
- When you create a Web App, Azure assigns the app to a subdomain of *azurewebsites.net*
	- Contoso web app is going to have the *contoso.azurewebsites.net* URI
- You can map your domain such as *contoso.azurewebsites.net* to a custom domain such as *myapp.com* with a custom domain name and a CNAME record
- You can also set a TLS/SSL certificate for your domain
	- Azure provides a free certificate for you if you don't have one
## Back up and Restore
- It lets your easily create backups manually or on a schedule
- It can be configured to be retained for a specific or indefinite amount of time
- You can restore your app or site to a snapshot of a previous state by overwriting the existing content or restoring to another app or site
- To use back up and restore feature , you need **Standard or Premium Tier App Service plan** for your app or site
- You'll need a Storage Account and container in the same subscription as the app to back up
- You can back up your application and any connected database to your app
- You can configure backups manually or on a schedule
- Partial backups are supported
- Backups can hold up to 10 GB of app and database content
