# Plan
- When a workload moves to the cloud they require some level of network isolation. Azure network services offer a range of components with functionalities and capabilities
- You can implement a VNET (Virtual Network) to create a **virtual representation** of your network in the cloud
- An Azure VNET is a **logical isolation of the Azure cloud resources**
- You can use VNETs to provision and manage **virtual private networks (VPNs)** in Azure
- Each VNET has its own CIDR block and can be **linked to** other VNETs and **on-premises networks**
- When the CIDR block don't overlap, you can link VNETs with an on-premises IT infrastructure to create **hybrid or cross-premises solutions**
- It's possible to control **DNS settings** for VNETs and segment it into **subnets**
# VNET
- You always lose **5 IP addresses** in the virtual network
	- 0: For network address
	- 1: For Gateway
	- 2-3: For DNS
	- 255: For Broadcast
- Although each VNET is in a region, it is not restricted to any data center (or AZ), it can be effectively anywhere in that region
- The resource created in a region will have a **Virtual** NIC attached to it, however the VNET can be in any AZ, not necessarily the same AZ your resource is created in
# Virtual Network Manager
- Management service that enables you to group, configure, deploy, and manage virtual networks globally  across subscription
- Network Groups can be defined to identify and logically segment your virtual networks
	- The network groups serve as a logical container of networking resources
- It's possible to manually select networks, they're known as **static membership**, or you set an Azure Policy that will dynamically include the networks for you based on certain criteria
	- As it works for group of users, when a group is dynamic, you **can't** include any network manually there
- Create the connectivity and/or security configurations applied to those network groups based on the topology and security needs
	- **A Mesh Network**
	- **Hub-And-Spoke Network**
- A security configuration allows you to define a **collection of rules** that you can apply to one or more network groups at the global level
# Subnets
- **Well-known contents were omitted from here**
## Reserved Addresses
- For each subnet, Azure **reserves five IP addresses**. The first four addresses and the last one.
- **192.168.1.0** - Identifies the VNET address
- **192.168.1.1** - Azure configures this address as the default gateway
- **192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3** - Azure maps these Azure DNS IP addresses to the VNET space
- **192.168.1.255** - Supplies the VNET broadcast address
# Public IP addresses
- **Dynamic Assignment**
	- Addresses **are assigned after** a public IP address is **associated to an Azure resource** and is started for the first time
	- It **can change** if a resource such as a virtual machine is stopped (deallocated) and then restarted through Azure
		- It stays the same if rebooted or stopped from within the guest OS
	- When a public IP address resource is **removed from a resource**, the dynamic **address is released**
- **Static Assignment**
	- Addresses **are assigned when** a public IP address is **created**
	- Static addresses **aren't released until** a public IP address resource is **deleted**
	- If the address isn't associated to a resource, you can **change the assignment method** after the address is created
		- If it was already assigned to a resource, you might not to
- A public IP address resource can be **associated** with NICs, Load Balancers, VPN Gateways, and Application Gateways
## SKUs
- **Basic SKU**
	- IP Assignment: Static or Dynamic
	- Security: Open by default
	- Resources: NICs, VPN Gateways, Application Gateways, and Load Balancers
	- Redundancy: Not zone redundant
- **Standard SKU**
	- IP Assignment: Static
	- Security: Secure by default, closed to inbound traffic
	- Resources: NICs or public standard load balancers
	- Redundancy: Zone redundant by default
# Network Security Groups
- A NSG contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic
- It can be associated to a **subnet or a network interface**
- The same security group can be associated to several **subnets**, but each subnet has a maximum of one associated security group
- Each **network interface** that exists in a subnet can have **zero, or one**, associated network security groups
- **Source and Destination Attributes**
	- This relation is interesting because you can **set that by IP addresses**, **by Service Tag** (when you want to manage any Azure service connection to this NSG)
	- We can also attach an **Application Security Group**. This is just a tag that we put on the NIC
- NSGs **are stateful**: it means if you allow inbound traffic, it is allowed outbound for the same traffic
## Rules
- Security rules in NSGs enable you to **filter** network traffic. You can define rules to control the traffic **flow in and out** of virtual network subnets and network interfaces
- Each rule is assigned a **priority**. All security rules for NSG are **processed in priority order**
	- Lower priority (5000) -> Higher Priority (100)
	- Lowest is the number higher is the priority for a rule
- Although you **can't remove** a default security rule (the one Azure automatically creates for all NSGs) you can **override it** creating a higher priority rule
- There is **inbound and outbound** rules
- For **inbound traffic** Azure **first processes** NSG rules associated to **subnets** and then **network interfaces**
- For **outbound traffic** it is the reverse: **network interfaces** are processed first, and then **subnets**
# VNET Peering
- VNET peering lets you connect virtual networks in the **same or different regions**
## Peering Uses
- Peering enables you to seamlessly connect two Azure virtual networks
- After the virtual networks are peered, the two virtual networks operate **as a single network**, for connectivity purposes
- There are two types of peering: **regional and global** ![[Pasted image 20241125093259.png]]
	- Regional connects Azure virtual networks that **exist in the same region**: it peers VNETs in East US for example
	- Global connects Azure virtual networks that **exist in different regions**: it peers VNETs in Japan and East US for example
- **Regional**: you can create it in the same Azure public cloud region, or in the same China cloud region, or in the same Microsoft Government cloud region
- **Global**: you can create it in any Azure public cloud region, or in any China cloud region
- Global Peering in different **Azure Government Cloud Regions isn't permitted**
## Gateway Transit and Connectivity
- Azure VPN Gateway in the peered virtual network can serve as a **transit point**
- The peered virtual network uses the remote VPN gateway to gain access to other resources, such as on-premises datacenters in a centralized way
	- That removes the necessity of each VNET has its own GatewaySubnet to access an external resource
- A VNET **can have** only **one VPN gateway**
- Gateway transit is supported for both regional and global virtual network peering
- When VPN gateway **transit is enabled**, the VNET can communicate to resources **outside the peering**
- Gateway transit allows peered virtual networks to share the gateway and get access to resources
# Azure Domain Name System
- Azure DNS lets you **host** your Domain Name System records for your domains on Azure infrastructure
- It can manage DNS records for your Azure services and provide DNS for your **external resources**
- Domains and records can be managed by using the portal, PowerShell cmdlets, or the azure CLI.
- Applications that require **automated DNS management** can integrate with the service by using the **REST API** and software development kit (SDKs)
## Private Zones
- These zones provide name resolution for VMs **within a virtual network and between virtual networks** without having to create a custom DNS solution
- Private zones allow you to use your own custom domain names rather than the Azure-provided names
# Azure Firewall
- It is a **PaaS firewall** that you have available in the Azure Cloud
- It also gets **FQDN support** for these fully qualified domain names
- What we need to manage is to create a subnet inside of our VNet for the firewall with the name **AzureFirewallSubnet** and **/26** CIDR block or lower in order to provision your Azure Firewall inside this VNet
- On the firewall you can control your traffic using **NAT rules**, **Application Rules**, and **Network Rules** in rule collections on this firewall or managing those rule collections inside an **Azure Policy**
- It should be deployed in the **same** region of your VNet
## Features
- **DNAT and SNAT**: Configure outbound/inbound NAT rules for your networks
- **Network Rules**: Configure network (layer 4) rules for what traffic is allowed
- **App Rules**: Configure rules for filter websites visited from your network
- **Threat Intel**: Identify malicious IPs and domains
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with Azure Monitor to capture firewall traffic
# Service Endpoint
- Service Endpoints are used to for connectivity to a Platform as a Service (PaaS) in Azure Cloud
- By default, Microsoft services have a **public endpoint**. 
	- Because of that, a VM will access an Azure file share from a storage account using a public endpoint (transit on the internet)
	- Not a private connection
- Service Endpoints provide private connectivity to a service **from inside your VNet**
	- A VM will access an Azure file share from a storage account using a service endpoint (transit on the Microsoft Azure Backbone)
	- Private connection
- Enabled **per subnet**
- Not all services are supported
	- Supported services differ per region
- The service endpoint does not provide a private IP, but provides **source IP as private IP**. What you have here is a route from our VNet subnet to the PaaS Service Microsoft Backbone
# Private Endpoint
- A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network
- The NIC connects you **privately** and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link
- Enabling private endpoint, you're **bringing the service into your VNET**
	- That's similar of what we do with AWS Lambda Functions within the VPC. The Lambda is usually an external service, but putting it in the VPC we make it private
- The NIC has the **private IP address** for the specific service and that's the private endpoint
# VPN
## VPN Gateway
- In Azure the VPN Gateway has the same purpose as a peering connection using VNET peering
- The difference between VPN Gateway and Peering, is that with VPN Gateway, we do specifically with our on-premise environments, rather
- It allows us to connect our on-premise environment with our VNETs in Azure **through the internet**
- The VPN components are a Gateway Subnet, a public IP per VNET gateway, IPsec tunnel for encryption
- VPN Gateways are **transitive**. That's a property VNET peering don't have
	- An on-premise network connected to VNET1 by VPN Gateway can communicate and receive traffic from VNET2 without direct connection, just by the VPN gateway
	![[Pasted image 20250321093255.png|500]]
## Routing Types

### Policy-Based
- Static routing via policy declaration
- Support to legacy on-premises VPN devices
- Only supports IKEv1 (encryption)
- Only basic SKU
### Route-Based
- Static and dynamic routing
- Resilient to topology changes
- Can coexist with ExpressRoute

## VPN Gateway SKUs

| SKU          | Site-To-Site Tunnels | Throughput | BGP Support   |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| **Basic**    | Max: 10              | 100 Mbps   | Not Supported |
| **VpnGw1AZ** | Max: 30              | 650 Mbps   | Supported     |
| **VpnGw2AZ** | Max: 30              | 1 Gbps     | Supported     |
| **VpnGw3AZ** | Max: 30              | 1.25 Gbps  | Supported     |
- There are a lot more generations and SKUs
## Active-Active vs Active-Passive
### Active-Passive
- By default, VPN gateways are deployed as **two instances** in an active/standby configuration
- Planned maintenance or unplanned disruption affects the active service, the standby instance automatically assumes responsibility
- Connections are **interrupted during this failover**, but typically restored within a few seconds for planned maintenance and within 90 seconds for unplanned disruptions
![[Pasted image 20250321094645.png|500]]
### Active-Active
- With BGP routing protocol, you can deploy VPN gateways in an active/active configuration
- Assign a unique **public IP address** to each instance.
- Create separate tunnels from the on-premises device to each IP address
![[Pasted image 20250321094630.png|500]]
### Demonstration Diagram
![[Pasted image 20250321095037.png|500]]
# ExpressRoute
- It is a service that we use in Azure to make a direct **physical** connection into our Azure resources and Microsoft resources. Physical dedicated connection from our on-premise networks
## Edge Locations
- To do the physical connection, we have the **Microsoft Edge Location** and a **Partner Edge Locations**
- The partner edge location can be an ISP that helps us to connect to the Microsoft side of the ExpressRoute
	- This partner can't be any ISP or something else, it should be an authorized and authenticated connection that operates through a partner-controlled router
- The partner extends the connection to the Microsoft Edge Location
- The Microsoft Edge Location effectively connects to the Microsoft Services (including the Azure of course)
![[Pasted image 20250322112627.png|500]]
- These connections allow to peer your on-premises networks with the virtual networks available through the endpoint, these connections are called **circuits**
- The **circuit** provides a physical connection for transmitting data through the ExpressRoute provider's edge routers to the Microsoft edge routers
- The circuit is established across a **private wire** rather than the public internet
## Peering Connections
- **Private Peering**
	- It connects to Azure IaaS and PaaS services deployed inside Azure virtual networks
	- Resources must all be located in one or more Azure virtual networks with private IP addresses. You **can't access** resources through their public IP address over a private peering
- **Microsoft Peering**
	- It connects to Azure PaaS services, Office 365 services, and Dynamics 365
# Virtual WAN
- It is a networking service that allows us a single, operational interface to be able to manage a hub-and-spoke style network and fully mesh networks inside of the Azure cloud
- It allows to manage, basically, our entire networks topology and the capabilities of those connections all through that single operational interface
- In the Virtual WAN we have: S2S connectivity; P2S connectivity; ExpressRoute; Intra-cloud connectivity; VPN ExpressRoute connectivity; Routing, Firewall, and encryption for private connectivity
## Architecture
- The Virtual WAN is a **hub and spoke architecture**
- It enables global transit network architecture, where the cloud hosted network hub enables transitive connectivity between endpoints
- The Azure regions serve as hubs that you can choose connect to
- All the single "hubs" are connected in a **full mesh** in a Standard Virtual WAN
![[Pasted image 20250323121652.png|500]]
## SKUs
- **Basic**
	- Transitive peering not supported
	- S2S VPN connections only
	- Upgrade to Standard supported
- **Standard**
	- Transitive peering supported
	- S2S VPN, P2S VPN, ExpressRoute, and VNet-to-VNet connections
# Network Watcher

- Overview of topologies
- Monitor connectivity in Azure
- Monitor connectivity in hybrid networks
- Troubleshoot connectivity issues
- Troubleshoot hybrid network solutions
- Enable per region in a subscription
## Monitoring Tools
- They are: Topology, Connection Monitor and Network Performance Monitor
- **Topology tool**: generates a graphical display of your Azure VNet, its resources, its interconnections, and their relationships with each other
- **Connection Monitor tool**: provides a way to check that connections work between Azure resources; to verify that two VMs can communicate if you want them to; it also measures latency between resources; it can probe VMs at regular intervals to look for failures or changes
- **Network Performance Monitor tool**: track and alert on latency and packet drops over times
## Diagnostic Tools
- They are: IP flow verify; NSG diagnostic; Next hop; Effective security rules; Packet capture; Connection troubleshoot; VPN troubleshoot
- **IP Flow Verify tool**: tells you whether packets are allowed or denied for a specific virtual machine; if the NSG denies a packet it tells you the name of that group so you can fix the problem
- **NSG Diagnostic tool**: provides detailed information about the security configuration of your network; the tool shows the NSGs that will be traversed, the rules that will be applied in each NSG, and the final allow/deny status for the flow
- **Next Hop tool**: determine how a packet gets from a VM to any destination; the tool determines the packet's route; that can be useful to diagnose problems with incorrect routing tables
- **Effective Security Rules tool**: displays all the effective NSG rules applied to a NIC
- **Packet Capture tool**: records all of the packets sent to and from a VM; you can review the capture to gather statistics about network traffic or diagnose anomalies, such as unexpected network traffic on a private virtual network
- **Connection Troubleshoot tool**: check TCP connectivity between a source and destination VM; the destination VM can be specified by using FQDN, a URI, or an IP address
- **VPN Troubleshoot tool**: diagnose problems with Virtual Network gateway connections; diagnoses the health of the gateway or connection and returns the appropriate results; it's a long-running transaction
## Traffic Logging Tools
- They are: Flow logs, Traffic analytics
- **Flow Logs tool**: log information about IP traffic through a NSG; stores data in Azure storage
- **Traffic Analysis tool**: provides visibility into user and application activity in your cloud networks; traffic analytics analyzes Network Watcher NSG flow logs to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud
