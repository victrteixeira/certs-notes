# Plan
- When a workload moves to the cloud they require some level of network isolation. Azure network services offer a range of components with functionalities and capabilities
- You can implement a VNET (Virtual Network) to create a **virtual representation** of your network in the cloud
- An Azure VNET is a **logical isolation of the Azure cloud resources**
- You can use VNETs to provision and manage **virtual private networks (VPNs)** in Azure
- Each VNET has its own CIDR block and can be **linked to** other VNETs and **on-premises networks**
- When the CIDR block don't overlap, you can link VNETs with an on-premises IT infrastructure to create **hybrid or cross-premises solutions**
- It's possible to control **DNS settings** for VNETs and segment it into **subnets**
# VNET
- You always lose **5 IP addresses** in the virtual network
	- 0: For network address
	- 1: For Gateway
	- 2-3: For DNS
	- 255: For Broadcast
- Although each VNET is in a region, it is not restricted to any data center (or AZ), it can be effectively anywhere in that region
- The resource created in a region will have a **Virtual** NIC attached to it, however the VNET can be in any AZ, not necessarily the same AZ your resource is created in
# Virtual Network Manager
- Management service that enables you to group, configure, deploy, and manage virtual networks globally  across subscription
- Network Groups can be defined to identify and logically segment your virtual networks
	- The network groups serve as a logical container of networking resources
- It's possible to manually select networks, they're known as **static membership**, or you set an Azure Policy that will dynamically include the networks for you based on certain criteria
	- As it works for group of users, when a group is dynamic, you **can't** include any network manually there
- Create the connectivity and/or security configurations applied to those network groups based on the topology and security needs
	- **A Mesh Network**
	- **Hub-And-Spoke Network**
# Subnets
- **Well-known contents were omitted from here**
## Reserved Addresses
- For each subnet, Azure **reserves five IP addresses**. The first four addresses and the last one.
- **192.168.1.0** - Identifies the VNET address
- **192.168.1.1** - Azure configures this address as the default gateway
- **192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3** - Azure maps these Azure DNS IP addresses to the VNET space
- **192.168.1.255** - Supplies the VNET broadcast address
# Public IP addresses
- **Dynamic Assignment**
	- Addresses **are assigned after** a public IP address is **associated to an Azure resource** and is started for the first time
	- It **can change** if a resource such as a virtual machine is stopped (deallocated) and then restarted through Azure
		- It stays the same if rebooted or stopped from within the guest OS
	- When a public IP address resource is **removed from a resource**, the dynamic **address is released**
- **Static Assignment**
	- Addresses **are assigned when** a public IP address is **created**
	- Static addresses **aren't released until** a public IP address resource is **deleted**
	- If the address isn't associated to a resource, you can **change the assignment method** after the address is created
		- If it was already assigned to a resource, you might not to
- A public IP address resource can be **associated** with NICs, Load Balancers, VPN Gateways, and Application Gateways
## SKUs
- **Basic SKU**
	- IP Assignment: Static or Dynamic
	- Security: Open by default
	- Resources: NICs, VPN Gateways, Application Gateways, and Load Balancers
	- Redundancy: Not zone redundant
- **Standard SKU**
	- IP Assignment: Static
	- Security: Secure by default, closed to inbound traffic
	- Resources: NICs or public standard load balancers
	- Redundancy: Zone redundant by default
# Network Security Groups
- A NSG contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic
- It can be associated to a **subnet or a network interface**
- The same security group can be associated to several **subnets**, but each subnet has a maximum of one associated security group
- Each **network interface** that exists in a subnet can have **zero, or one**, associated network security groups
## Rules
- Security rules in NSGs enable you to **filter** network traffic. You can define rules to control the traffic **flow in and out** of virtual network subnets and network interfaces
- Each rule is assigned a **priority**. All security rules for NSG are **processed in priority order**
	- Lower priority (5000) -> Higher Priority (100)
	- Lowest is the number higher is the priority for a rule
- Although you **can't remove** a default security rule (the one Azure automatically creates for all NSGs) you can **override it** creating a higher priority rule
- There is **inbound and outbound** rules
- For **inbound traffic** Azure **first processes** NSG rules associated to **subnets** and then **network interfaces**
- For **outbound traffic** it is the reverse: **network interfaces** are processed first, and then **subnets**
# VNET Peering
- VNET peering lets you connect virtual networks in the **same or different regions**
## Peering Uses
- Peering enables you to seamlessly connect two Azure virtual networks
- After the virtual networks are peered, the two virtual networks operate **as a single network**, for connectivity purposes
- There are two types of peering: **regional and global** ![[Pasted image 20241125093259.png]]
- Global Peering in different **Azure Government Cloud Regions isn't permitted**
## Gateway Transit and Connectivity
- Azure VPN Gateway in the peered virtual network can serve as a **transit point**
- The peered virtual network uses the remote VPN gateway to gain access to other resources, such as on-premises datacenters in a centralized way
	- That removes the necessity of each VNET has its own GatewaySubnet to access an external resource
- A VNET **can have** only **one VPN gateway**
- Gateway transit is supported for both regional and global virtual network peering
- When VPN gateway **transit is enabled**, the VNET can communicate to resources **outside the peering**
- Gateway transit allows peered virtual networks to share the gateway and get access to resources
# Azure Domain Name System
- Azure DNS lets you **host** your Domain Name System records for your domains on Azure infrastructure
- It can manage DNS records for your Azure services and provide DNS for your **external resources**
- Domains and records can be managed by using the portal, PowerShell cmdlets, or the azure CLI.
- Applications that require **automated DNS management** can integrate with the service by using the **REST API** and software development kit (SDKs)
## Private Zones
- These zones provide name resolution for VMs **within a virtual network and between virtual networks** without having to create a custom DNS solution
- Private zones allow you to use your own custom domain names rather than the Azure-provided names
