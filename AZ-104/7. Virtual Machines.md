# Availability
## Availability Options
- **Availability Zones**
- **Virtual Machines Scale Sets**
- **Availability Sets**
- Load Balancer
- Azure Site Recovery
## Availability Zones
- An Availability Zone is a physically separate zone, within an Azure region
- There are **three AZs per supported Azure region** (usually)
- Replicated VMs in zones, you can protect your apps and data from the loss of a data center.
- If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly available in another zone
## Virtual Machine Scale Sets
- It let you create and manage a **group of load balanced VMs**
- The number of VM instances can **automatically** increase or decrease in response to demand or defined schedule
- VMs in a scale set can also be deployed into **multiple availability zones**, a **single availability zone**, or **regionally**
## Availability Sets
- It is a **logical grouping** of VMs that reduce the change of correlated failures bringing down related VMs at the same time.
- ASs place VMs in different **fault domains** for better reliability.
	- Especially beneficial if a region **doesn't** support AZs
- ASs are place in the same Azure Data Center Zone
- It offers improved VM-to-VM latencies compared to AZs, because VMs in an AS are allocated in closer proximity
- ASs are still susceptible to certain **shared infrastructure failures**, like datacenter network failure which can affect multiple fault domain
# SKUs and Attributes
- **B-Series**: for light use **burstable** workloads
- **D-Series**: for standard, well balanced compute/memory workloads
- **E-Series**: are memory focused VM sizes
- **F-Series**: are CPU focused VM sizes
- **NV-Series**: are VMs that have GPUs in them to support GPU-based workloads
## Attributes
- Attributes are letters that come after the VM family and number of cores: **D8ads_v5**
- **[Family] + [Number of Cores] + [Number of Constraint Cores]** **+ [Attributes] + [Version Number]**
- **Constraint Cores**: 
	- for example *E8-4as_v4*
	- The lower number denotes the number of CPUs that VM is constraint to, but since the number of cores on this SKU is still 8 cores, you will **retain the amount of memory** and every other property of that 8 core E series machine
	- That's for when you need that amount of memory, but don't want the full amount of CPU as you're working with a more memory-related workload and the CPUs are not necessary
	- for SQL workloads as an example, is that a user might want a lot more memory that would typically be in a E8 machine (64GB of RAM) but don’t need the extra CPUs since it is not needed
- Attributes are features added to a VM
	- The ability to mount Premium SSD's in it
	- Temporary Disk for log storage or Ephemeral OS Disk
	- A specific CPU chip, such as AMD chip instead of default intel
