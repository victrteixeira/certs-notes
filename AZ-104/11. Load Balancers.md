# Overview

- Azure Load Balancer can be used for **inbound and outbound scenarios**
- You can implement **public** or **internal** load balancer, or use both types in a combination configuration
- The implementation of a load balancer is composed by four components: Front-end IP configuration; Back-end pools; Health probes; Load-balancing rules
	- **Front-end**: specifies the public IP or internal IP that your load balancer responds to
	- **Back-end**: they're your services and resources, including VMs or instances in VMSS
	- **Load-Balancing Rules**: determine how traffic is distributed to back-end resources
	- **Health Probes**: ensure the resources in the backend are healthy to receive traffic
- **Public** Load Balancer Definition: use public load balancers to map the public IP addresses and port numbers of incoming traffic to the private IP addresses and port numbers of virtual machines
- **Private** Load Balancer Definition: use internal load balancers to direct traffic to resources that reside in a virtual network, or to resources that use a VPN to access Azure infrastructure
# SKUs
- Azure Load Balancers has three options of **Stock Keeping Unit** (SKU): **Basic**, **Standard**, and Gateway
- Each SKU provides different features, scenario scaling, and pricing
- Standard is essentially a superset of Basic Load Balancer
- Standard offers an expanded and more granular feature set than the basic SKU
- Basic SKU can be upgraded to Standard, but new designs and architectures should use the Standard SKU
- Gateway supports high performance and high availability scenarios with third-party network virtual appliances (NVAs)

| Feature                | Basic SKU                                                                | Standard SKU                                                                                                                                        |

| **Security**           | - Open by default<br>- Control through network<br>security groups (NSGs) | - Closed to inbound flows unless<br>allowed by an NSG<br>- Internal traffic from the virtual<br>network to the internal load<br>balancer is allowed |
# Back-end Pools
- The back-end pools contain the IP addresses of the virtual NICs that are connected to your load balancer
- The SKU type of the load balancer determines the endpoint configurations supported for the pool along with the number of pool instances allowed
- When configuring back-end pools, you can connect to Availability Sets, VMs, or VMSS.
- Basic SKU you can select VMs in a single availability set or VMs in an instance of VMSS
- Standard SKU, you can select VMs or VMSS in a single VNET.
	- Your configuration can include a combination of VMs, Availability Sets, and VMSS
# Health Probes
- A health probe allows your load balancer to **monitor** the status of your application
- The probe dynamically adds or removes VMs from your load balancer rotation based on the machine response to health checks
	- When a probe fails, load balancer stops sending new connections to the unhealthy instance
# Rules
- Define load-balancing rules to specify **how** traffic is distributed to your back-end pools
- Each rule **maps** a front-end IP address and port combination to a **set of back-end IP address and port combination**
