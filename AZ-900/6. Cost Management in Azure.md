- One of the benefits of cloud computing is the flexibility in pricing options. You can choose to have relative certainty over the monthly bill. Or choose to (possibly) save money by paying only for what you use.
# Factors that Affect Cost
- Pricing estimates are difficult to make accurate since there are so many factors
----------------------
- Time
- Consumption (Storage, Compute, Bandwidth)
- Service Tier
- Computing Power (vCPUs/RAM/CPU type)
- Software Licenses
- Bandwidth (Egress from Azure)
- bandwidth (Between Azure Regions)
- IP Addresses
- Reservations
- Per Transaction
## Caveats
- Ingress bandwidth is free
- First 5 GB outbound is free
- There are free and cheap options for many things (i.e. Free distros of Linux and paid distros of Linux)
- There are DEV software licenses for things (like SQL Server)
- There are usually four or five ways to implement a technique (with tradeoffs for SLA and latency)
- Many services have multiple pricing options (monthly or consumption)
# Resource Tags
- You can use tags to group your billing data. 
	- For example, tag VMs by cost center if running multiple VMs for different organizations.
- Tags can also categorize costs by runtime environment, such as production VMs.
- Retrieve tag information by downloading the usage file from the Azure portal.
- Tags appear in the Tags column for services supporting billing tags.
