# Azure Compute Services
- "Executing code" in the cloud
- Virtual Machines (VM)
- VM Scale Sets (VMSS)
- App services (Web apps)
- Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
- Azure Virtual Desktop
## Virtual Machines
- This is the closest analogue to a "server" in cloud computing
- But it's **virtual**: that is, a single physical machine has been subdivided into slices and you get to rent a single slice of it
- Infrastructure as a Service - IaaS
- Take an existing machine from your environment into the cloud - a copy
- Windows or Linux operating systems - several of each
- A "slice" of a physical machine shared with other costumers
- Full control over it, as if it was your machine
### Standalone Server Analogy
- Think of a **standalone self-hosted server** as a single-detached house
- You can do whatever you want with it (generally)
- It's very difficult to do anything that affects your neighbors (soundproof walls)
- You don't share any services with you neighbors besides garbage, sewer, water, electricity - provided by the city
### Virtualization Analogy
- Think of a **host** as an apartment building on the same land
- And a **virtual machine** as an apartment in that building
- You're using common services like garbage, sewer, water, electricity - provided by the landlord (Azure)
- Other services available like shared gym, heating/cooling, landscaping and snow removal
- It's generally cheaper to rent an apartment than a house
- When you're inside the apartment, it's hard to tell that it's not a house.

### Virtual Machine Types
- Over 700 to choose from
- Number of CPU cores, CPU speed, RAM size, temporary disk size, IOPS, etc
## Virtual Machine Scale Sets
- You can increase the size of a VM easily, turning a 4 vCPU VM into an 8 vCPU VM in minutes (scale up)
	- Can go to 64 vCPUs or higher
- Or you can add more VMs and have them work together to handle the work (scale out)
- VMSS is a group of virtual machines that can grow and shrink in quantity based on a predefined rule
	- Usually based on monitoring demand
	- Can be based on time (schedule)
	- Can be based on many other factors
- **Two or more virtual machines running the exact same code**
- With a "load balancer" in front to direct traffic randomly to one of the machines
- Able to add more machines as demand grows (autoscaling)
- Able to reduce machines as demand slows
- Can handle up to 100 VMs in a single scale set
- Can be configured to increase that to 1000 VMs in a single scale set
- If you need more, you can create more VMSS
## App Services (Web Apps)
- A new paradigm for running code in the cloud
- Give your code and configuration to Azure, and they will run it
- Promise of performance but no access to hardware
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
## Container Services
- Another paradigm for running code in the cloud
- Containers contain everything the app needs to run in a "container image"
- Fastest and easiest to deploy
- **Azure Container Instance (ACI)** - single instance, quickest way to deploy a container
- **Azure Container Apps** - easy to use like a web service, with advanced features
- **Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)** - runs on a cluster of servers, enterprise-grade
## Azure Virtual Desktop
- Desktop version of Windows that runs in the cloud
- Your software installed, your files - available from anywhere
- Can even see your desktop on iOS and Android, or from any web browser
- Runs on Azure
## Azure Functions
- Small pieces of code that run entirely in the cloud
- Utility function - does something specific in a finite amount of time
- Is triggered by something happening
	- HTTP call, timer, blob creation, message queue, other
- Very inexpensive
- Free tier - one million executions per month free
	- Serverless model
- Can support more complicated designs
	- Durable functions
	- Long-running functions
	- Premium or dedicated hosting options
# Azure Networking Services
- Sometimes called Virtual Networks (or VNets)
- Microsoft has an extensive global network of cables, switches and routes - physical network
## Virtual Networks
- Virtual networks have an analogue to the physical networks we would set up in our own office or data center - infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- In Azure, it's virtual because it's effectively just a database entry in a table that establishes the path between VM A to VM B
- Virtual Networks are assigned an address space of either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, or both
- These are private addresses, which cannot be accessed from outside of Azure or other networks inside of Azure
- A single VNet is usually assigned a large quantity address space to support potential future growth
- There is no shortage of private IP addresses
### Subnets
- All VNets are subdivided into one or more subnets
- The subnet is assigned a range of IP addresses which must exist in the address space of the parent VNet
- Usually there is a security layer between subnets; traffic must match a predefined ruleset to pass
- All VMs must belong to at least one subnet, using a Network Interface Card (NIC)
- Some VMs have more than one NIC and can connect to more than one subnet
- VMs can optionally be assigned a public IP, which makes it eligible to be accessed from outside Azure (subnet to security/firewalls)
### Network Security Group
- Called an NSG
- An access control list (ACL) that blocks traffic inbound and outbound from a subnet unless it matches certain rules
- The rules are based on source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol (5-tuple match)
- You can allow communication between different subnets on the same network through adding specific NSG rules
- No traffic passes the NSG filter unless an "ALLOW" rule matches
- Rules have priorities, and the highest priority rule that matches is the one that applies
## Peering
- Communication is blocked between two subnets on a different networks
- Connecting two subnets together is called peering
- This allows communication between a VM on one network and a VM on a different network
## DNS
- DNS stands for Domain Name System
- You can give your IP addresses names using a DNS
- DNS only applies internally to Azure to applied networks
### Example of Azure DNS
- http://development.local
- http://database.local
- http://staging.local
- http://dev.domain.com
## VPN Gateway
- VPN is Virtual Private Network
- Allows communication between a workstation and a network, or between two networks
- Encrypts traffic between those two points
### VPNs
- Outside of Azure, VPNs require a physical device to be installed on a network
- Inside of Azure, you can install a VPN Gateway as a virtual device on your network
- VPN Gateway requires its own subnet
### VPN Peering
- You can also connect two distant networks using VPN devices
- This is called "site to site" VPN, or S2S
- Can connect an entire office of computers to an Azure subnet, or two offices together
## ExpressRoute
- If communicating into Azure at high speeds is important to you, you might want to look into ExpressRoute
- A private endpoint from your ISP to an Azure endpoint
- Bypasses the public internet
