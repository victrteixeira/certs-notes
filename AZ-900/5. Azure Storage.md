# Azure Storage (GPv2)
- "Standard Storage"
- Subdivided into four types of data it can store
	- Container, File, Queue, Table
- Can hold up to 5 Petabytes (5PB) = 5 million GB
- Pay for what you use
- ~2 cents per GB per month
- Extremely cheap cloud storage
- Not recommended for high-demand workloads
## Data Lake
- A setting when creating a GPv2 storage account
- A data lake is extremely large storage
- Can hold petabytes and exabytes
- Good for "big data" analytics
## Premium Storage Options
- Blob storage - can only hold containers (blobs)
	- Can choose block blobs or page blobs
- File storage
- Uses premium SSD (solid state disks)
- Triple de "operations per second (OPS)"
- Lower latency (time to first byte)
- More expensive
### High Performance
- Premium SSD
- Premium SSD v2
- Ultra Disk
# Container (Blob) Storage
## Binary Large Object (BLOB)
- These are files of any type (TXT, PDF, ZIP, CSV, XLSX, JPG, AVI,..., any)
- Stored loosely in a container
- Public or private
- "Unstructured data"
## Container Storage
- Create multiple containers
- Each container can contain blobs
- Can be organized into folders (yes and no)
- Only pay for what you use
## Location
- You can create multiple storage accounts in any region of the world
- Keep your data close to the person/service consuming it (for access speed reasons)
- Prices varies by region
## Redundancy
- Azure keeps 3 copies of your data by default
- Locally - or zone - redundant
- Azure will almost never, ever lose a file once it's successfully received it
### Global Redundancy
- You can choose global redundancy for storage
- Azure keeps 6 copies of your data
- 3 locally, and 3 in another region of the "geo"
- Honors data sovereignty laws
## Access Tiers
- Four access tiers:
	- **Hot**: the default, balanced access
	- **Cool**: can be set as default, cheaper storage with more expensive read/write operations
	- **Cold**: much cheaper storage, more expensive read/write operations
	- **Archive**: cannot get immediate access to files, cheapest storage, most expensive operations
## Failover
- Hard disks fail every so often
- Azure takes care of this without you doing anything
- 3 copies of your data, they can recreate a hard disk behind the scenes
# Azure File Storage
- True hierarchical structure with folders
- You can "mount" this storage to a server and use a drive letter with it (i.e. "S: drive") - Windows, Linux, macOS
- Supports SMB, or NFS (Linux)
## Why?
- Replace or supplement your on-premise file storage
- Lift and shift migration to the cloud
- Adds redundancy, data recovery, failover benefits
## Azure File Sync
- Hybrid option - on-prem files with cloud option
- Cloud tiering
- Distributed access
- Cloud backup
# Azure Migrate
- Guided experience to get your workloads into Azure
- A tool to help you discover servers and database in your environment
- Make plans to migrate them into Azure
- Which servers can be migrated as-is and which need upgrades

# Azure Databox
- It's impractical to upload some quantities of data to the Cloud
- There are: **Data Box** (100TB), **Data Box Disk** (8TB), and **Data Box Heavy** (1PB)
- Physically shipping your data to Azure and having it show up in your account
- Encrypted, wiped-clean after use
