# Public and Private Endpoints
### Public Endpoints
- Por padrão, serviços geralmente tem um **public endpoint**, ou address, que permite a interação com a internet: **internet routable**
- Um public endpoint, não significa que qualquer pessoa possa se comunicar com ele. Quase todos os public endpoints na Azure requerem um certo de nível de **autenticação**.
- Geralmente, public endpoints tem um **firewall**, e é possível utilizar este firewall para permitir somente um certo **set of IPs** de comunicar com o recurso
	- Example: On-Premise Network CIDR Block
- **Service Endpoints** permite que certos serviços se tornem **known entities** para o firewall, permitindo assim seu acesso irrestrito àquele public endpoint específico
	- Example: VNET/Subnet Service Endpoint
### Private Endpoints
- Um **private endpoint** é um **IP Address** de dentro de uma específica subnet que especificamos.
- Pode-se pensar nisto como uma **network interface** atrelado dentro de uma subnet
# Database Resources
### SQL Server
- SQL Server is the Relational Database Solution of Microsoft
- **Azure SQL Database**: completed managed offering as a PaaS
- **Azure SQL Managed Instances**: Run in your VNET; Dedicated Instances; Great Compatibility with existing workloads
### Open-Source
- Azure provides Managed Databases for those Open-Source database solutions
- **MySQL/MariaDB**
- **PostgreSQL**
	- PostgreSQL tem um serviço chamado CITUS: multi-server and sharding data
	- There is a hyper scale offer in Azure for CITUS
### CosmosDB

	- Document: **MongoDB**
	- Columnar: **Cassandra**
	- Table: **Azure Storage Tables; ETCD**
	- Graph: **Gremlin**
# Data Movement and Migration Options
### Azure File Sync
- Permite a **sincronização** dos file shares de uma organização como servidores Windows on-premises com **protocolo SMB** para a Azure, com Azure File Sync.
- Azure Storage Account **Files** é o local onde os arquivos ficam armazenados e são possivelmente acessados.
- Cada File Share no servidor de origem terá um **Server Endpoint**
	- Up to 100 server endpoints
- Azure Files terá um **Cloud Endpoint**.
	- Only one as far as I know
- Estes endpoints estarão em algo chamado **Sync Group**, que realizará a sincronização dos arquivos entre a Azure e os servidores
- Os protocolos disponíveis são: **SMB, NFS, e FTPS**
- É possível, transferir os arquivos para a Azure e descontinuar os file shares nos servidores on-premises, ou utilizar o Azure Files como uma medida de **resiliência** dos arquivos.
#### Cloud Tiering
- Cloud Tiering permite realizar o **off-load** de arquivos menos utilizados On-Premises, e despejá-los no Azure Files para liberar espaço.
	- Similar ao que o S3 Tiering é.
	- Files not being used for a certain amount of time can be **moved to** the Cloud
### DataBox

# Microsoft Sentinel
- **SIEM**: Security Information and Event Management
- **SOAR**: Security Orchestration Automation Response Tool
- Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) that delivers an intelligent and comprehensive solution for SIEM and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR).
- Microsoft Sentinel provides cyberthreat detection, investigation, response, and proactive hunting, with a bird's-eye view across your enterprise.
# Concept of Zero Trust
### Three Key Principals
1. Verify Explicitly
   - For every single aspect of an interaction, we should revalidate: who you're, your credentials and authorization, etc.
   - It could be a role, a service, an user, etc
2. Least Privilege
   - Just enough permission; only the permissions necessary to do the actual job should be designated
3. Assume Breach
   - We assume they're already in the network; We're going to treat our internal network as we treat the external network, or the internet
# DDoS Protection
### Types of
- Volumetric
	- Enche o serviço de tráfico com ondas e ondas de requests: UDP Flood, ICMP Flood
- Protocol
	- Ataque a um protocolo específico, como TCP ou UDP
- Application
	- Explora uma vulnerabilidade da própria aplicação: HTTP Flooding, Slow Post, or Slow Read
### Azure Protection
- **DDoS Network Protection**: Protege recursos específicos em uma virtual network. Providencia recursos aprimorados de mitigação de ataques DDoS.
- **DDoS IP Protection**: *Pay-per-protected IP model*. Contém o mesmo núcleo de features que o DDoS Network Protection, mas difere nos seguintes serviços: **DDoS rapid response support, cost protection, and discounts on WAF**.
# Azure Blueprints
- Blueprints helps to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements
- They're a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts
	- Role Assignments
	- Policy Assignments
	- ARM Templates
	- Resource Groups
- Blueprint assignment to a subscription: with **don't lock** the blueprint can modify, delete, create and so on in a subscription. With **do not delete**, a blueprint can modify, create and so on, but not delete anything in the subscription. With **read only** the blueprint can't delete or modify anything in the subscription
- A blueprint has a version control each time it is assigned to a subscription. It's possible to update assignments changing the blueprint.
# CapEx, OpEx and Consumption-based
### Capital Expenditure - CapEx
- The idea of purchasing an asset upfront and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time.
### Operational Expenditure - OpEx
- The idea of purchasing an resource or asset as we use it. There's no upfront cost, it's just **consumption-based**.
# Big Data and Analytic Services
### ETL Concept
- Extract, Transform and Load for Analytics
- Another variant of ETL is ELT which is Extract, Load and Transform
