- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Serverless
# "As a Service" Term
- You can rent it for a short time, if you wish
- No commitment, if you wish
- Pay for what you use (time, GB, or other)
- Cloud provider takes care of buying, developing, and maintaining it
# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- These are the essential services of technology
	- Computing
	- Storage
	- Networking
- Generally have "real world" equivalents in your own data center
- Cloud replacements of real world things
## IaaS Computing
- One example is Azure Virtual Machines
- Pay by the second
- Many choices in CPU speeds, RAM, optimizations
## IaaS Storage
- Azure Storage is one example of this
- 5PB of storage capacity
- Can handle blobs, files, queues, and tables
- Can also be configured as a data lake
## IaaS Networking
- Virtual Networking is an example of this
- Virtual Networking don't cost anything
- There are ingress and egress bandwidth costs
# Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Cloud service providers have an opportunity to provide mor than just the "basic" infrastructure
- PaaS includes a service layer on top of IaaS - computing, storage and networking
- Middleware, development tools, database server, and more
## PaaS Computing
- One example is Azure App Services
- Simply upload your code and configuration to Azure, and it runs your code without needing to worry about the VM underneath
- Includes scaling features, CI/CD, containers, staging and development environments, etc
## PaaS Storage
- Managed Storage is an example of this
	- Azure SQL Database is another example
- Freed from worrying about the server VM itself or the hard disk itself
## PaaS Networking
- Azure Frontdoor is an example of this
	- Or LoadBalancer
	- Or Firewall
- These are software applications that perform network tasks
# Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Cloud Apps
- Tools such as Office 365, OneDrive, Skype
- The app is ready to be used and you simply need to set it up and use it
# Serverless
- Some services in Azure have a "Serverless" option
- Serverless is effectively a different pricing model
- Paying for service not renting hardware
## Services
- Functions
- Container Apps
- Kubernetes
- SQL Database
- Cosmos DB
