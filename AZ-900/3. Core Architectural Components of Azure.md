# Regions, Region Pairs and Sovereign Regions
## Regions
- Areas of the world where Azure has a **set of datacenters** (minimum 3 in a set)
- Not necessarily "countries" but can be
- Usually each region is connected to another region to make a "region pair"
- Region pairs have highest speed connections and special treatment during Azure updates
## Region Pairs
- Many regions also have a paired region to support cross-region replication based on proximity and other factors
- While Azure regions are designed to offer protection against local disasters with AZs, they can also provide protection from regional or large geography disasters
- Making use of another secondary region that uses **cross-region replication** (CRR). Both primary and secondary regions together form a **region pair**
### Example Pairs
- Canada: Canada Central - Canada East
- Europe: North Europe - West Europe
- USA: East US - West US
- USA: East US 2 - Central US
- Brazil: Brazil South - South Central US
## Sovereign Regions
- These are not connected to the Azure Public Cloud
- Require approval to join / create a subscription
- Adhere to different compliance standards
- They're isolated from the rest of Azure and are dedicated to specific entities, such as governments
# Availability Zones and Data Centers
- Azure AZs are physically separe locations within each Azure region
- Each AZ can have one or more datacenters
- Each AZ has its own independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure
- Not every region supports AZs
	- Canada East does not have AZs, for example
- Not every service supports AZs
- There are **three types of AZ Services**: Zonal Services; Zone-Redundant Services; Always Available Services
	- Some services give you the choice between zonal and zone-redundant
## Zonal Services
- You can choose a specific AZ to deploy the service to
- You then should deploy a duplicate service to another zone to achieve resiliency
- e.g. Virtual Machines
## Zone-Redundant Services
- Automatically deployed across zones for you
- You don't have to configure it
- e.g. Azure SQL Database
## Always Available Services
- These are global services and Microsoft takes care of the ensuring that they are always on
- Also called "Non-regional services"
- e.g. Azure Portal, Azure Active Directory, Azure Front Door
# Resources and Resource Groups
![[Pasted image 20240601131420.png|300]]
## Resources
- A generic word to represent an Azure service that you have access to, such as a specific Virtual Machine, Storage Account, or Database
- You can create a resource in many different ways - Azure Portal, CLI, PowerShell, ARM Template, etc
- Each resource has a name created by you
- Sometimes it has to be unique, sometimes not
- Generally, you indicate the region where they are to be created
### All Resources
- A brand new subscription is created with no resources
- Most resources have costs associated with them
- The resource is associated with one (**and only one**) subscription, to which its cost is billed
## Resource Groups
- A logical grouping of resources
- Resource Group associated with a region, which can be different than the resources it contains
- All services in a resource group should have a similar lifecycle - deploy together, delete together
- All resources must belong to one and only one resource group
- Permissions can be assigned at the resource group level
- There is no security boundary offered by a resource group for communications

# Subscriptions
![[Pasted image 20240601131420.png|300]]
- The billing unit within Azure
- Always a payment method associated with a subscription
- Users can have access to more than one subscription, and different roles
## Subscription Plans
- Free plan - $200 credits first 30 days
	- Can only have one
- Pay as you Go - billed to credit card
- Enterprise Agreement - EA
- Free credits - MSDN, Startup plans
## Multiple Subscriptions
- Some companies can choose to have multiple subscriptions
- Can be used to separate out business units within an organization - e.g. Sales, IT, Finance
- Or separate by geography - e.g. North America, Europe, Asia
- It's possible to operate an entire organization on a single subscription
# Management Groups
![[Pasted image 20240601131420.png|300]]
![[Pasted image 20240601134221.png|300]]
- With many Azure subscriptions, seems to be necessary to have a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliances for those subscriptions.
- Management groups provide a governance scope above subscriptions.
- You organize subscriptions into management groups
- The governance conditions you apply cascade by inheritance to all associated subscriptions
- All subscriptions within a single management group must trust the same Entra ID tenant
